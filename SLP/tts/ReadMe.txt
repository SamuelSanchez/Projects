*****
- In order to run this program, you need xterm, which I think it comes
  by default with unix os.

- Every sentence has a period of 10 seconds, regardless if the sentence is
  short or long. The period (Thread.sleep) is set to 10 seconds to prevent
  overlapping of clips playing at the same time.
